This is an adaptation the API SDK we use internally for [Stakeo](https://stakeo.com). Many features are currently unavailable but we plan to fully support all Switcheo TradeHub capabilities as soon as possible. Please understand that this is an early release, so many things will likely change and/or break over time.
